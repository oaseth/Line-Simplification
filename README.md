# Line-Simplification
This repository contains a program for simplifying linear rings or linestrings using part of Imai & Iri's line simplification algorithm and linear programming (LP). 

# Input
- A set of linear rings or linestrings
- Some parameters including error tolerance, threshold angle, fraction of vertices, etc.

# Output
- A set of simplified linear rings or linestrings

The output:
